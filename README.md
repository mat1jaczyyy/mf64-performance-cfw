# Midi Fighter 64 performance-optimized Custom Firmware

This repository contains the source code of my custom firmware for the Launchpad Pro. The firmware retains all functionality (even Ableton Live integration) from the stock firmware in addition to Apollo Studio support. The modification is easy to install, free to use and works with every currently existing project or DAW.

## Installation

Midi Fighter Utility

## Building

1. Open Atmel Studio
2. On the start page or in the menu select
"Open Project..."
3. Select "Midi Fighter 64.atsln" from inside the midi_fighter_64 directory
- It will be the one with the Red Atmel Studio Icon.
4. Wait for the project to load up. Then press 'F7' (or click the menu Build->Build)
- The project will build.
- The output file will be located at "midi_fighter_64/Midi Fighter 64.hex"
- This output file can be uploaded to a Midifighter 64 using the MIDI Fighter Utility's Load Custom Firmware feature.
